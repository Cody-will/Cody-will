Software Engineer
-----------------

I started programming in 2014, I started off with HTML and CSS. I took a break for a little while to decide what I wanted to do, career wise, in the meantime. I worked in multiple positions for a Walmart Distribution Center in South Georgia from 2014 to 2022 with my most recent position held in the company being an area manager. I enjoyed the job and the people I worked with, but I was just starting to realize it wasn't where I wanted to be. During my time there I started using Python to solve some problems we had and make some of the processes more efficient. Thats when I really started to realize what I wanted to do with my life. Programming has always been one of those things I keep coming back to. I love the problem solving aspect (it's like one big puzzle to me) and being able to take a blank slate and see it come to life and do the job I intended it to do. You know what they say, if you do what you love for a living, you'll never work a day in your life.
